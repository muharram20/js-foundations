# JS Foundations

This repository documents my journey learning JavaScript from scratch.

## Current Focus
- Variables (`let`)
- Data types (strings)
- console.log()
- Variable reassignment
- Template literals

## Structure
Each folder represents one week of learning.

## Practice Projects
- Console-based JavaScript programs to practice variables, strings,
  and updating values dynamically.

## Goal
Build strong programming fundamentals to work remotely and prepare for advanced fields like web development and AI.
