# JS Foundations

This repository documents my journey learning JavaScript from scratch.

## Current Focus
- Variables (`let`, `const`)
- Data types (strings, numbers, booleans)
- console.log()
- Comparisons (`> < >= <= === !==`)
- if / else statements
- Basic functions

## Structure
Each file represents one day of learning.

Example:
- day1-variables.js  
- day2-strings.js  
- day3-booleans.js  
- day4-if-else.js  
- day5-practice.js  
- day6-functions.js  

## Practice
- Console-based JavaScript programs
- Small exercises for logic and problem solving

## Goal
Build strong programming fundamentals to prepare for web development, AI, and remote work.
